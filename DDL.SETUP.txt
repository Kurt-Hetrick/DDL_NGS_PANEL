------------------------------

1. Copy the dir /ddl_annovar_db over to /usr/local/sandbox.

Permissions should be readable (and I think executable would be fine as well) by DDL user group but not write.

General Question (document these "dbs"?)

2. Copy the dir /ddl_pipeline_files over to /usr/local/sandbox

Permissions are the same as #1.

3. Both of these should go to a network share that cannot be seen via the browser i.p., and on an isilon network share

This Share is only accesible to root.

4. Executables

	A. BWA is bwa-0.7.5a
	B. Picard is 1.103
		a. Except for CalculateHSmetrics.jar which is modified by Brian from the 1.57 source code.
	C. GATK is GATK-2.7-4
	D. verifyBamID is 1.0.0 (2012/06/20)
	E. bedtools is version 2.16.2 (will probably not be used by Sean)
	F. samtools is version 0.1.18 (I am not sure at the moment if Sean uses this or not)
	G. bgzip is version 0.2.6
	H. tabix is version 0.2.6
	I. vcfutils.pl is distributed with samtools version 0.1.18
	J. annovar version 2013_02_21
	K. Also need to have the annovar stuff (at least some perl scripts) over in here
	
	--For right now, copy the dir ddl_exectuables over to a network share--if we are pressed to move them to a local space, then the dir can go to /usr/local/sandbox as well.
	--both to the same network share as the other two folders above, also some network share where it is readable by ddl group.

5. Others
	R. is 2.15.0 (I am assuming that Keith used a rpm here).
		A. install packages
			install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gtools", "caTools", "gdata", "reshape", "gsalib"))
			R CMD INSTALL /isilon/isilon-cgc/ddl_programs/gplots_2.11.0.tar.gz
