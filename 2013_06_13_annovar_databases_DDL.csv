avsift,/mnt/clinical/ddl/NGS/Panel_Resources/annovar_db/,filter,-sift 0,SiftScore,SIFT takes a query sequence and uses multiple alignment information to predict tolerated and deleterious substitutions for every position of the query sequence.  Positions with normalized probabilities less than 0.05 are predicted to be deleterious; those greater than or equal to 0.05 are predicted to be tolerated.
